# Electric-Simulation
An electric simulation writed from zero which writed using c++ and LDL-Graphic-Lib

### IMPORTANT NOTE: I know it is a simulation but i stopped doing after second object becouse of school so we are only have batteries and resistors.

### Basics
* Connected wires are same color, didnt connected wires are diffrent color. (wires splitted by objects include didnt connected.)
